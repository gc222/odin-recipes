            Cook sweet potato noodles in the boiling water, stirring 
            occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 
            6 to 7 minutes. Rinse noodles under cold water and drain. 
            Transfer noodles to a bowl, add 2 tablespoons sauce, and 
            toss to coat.

        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook spinach in the 
            boiling water until just wilted, about 1 minute. Drain 
            quickly and transfer spinach to a bowl of cold water to 
            stop the cooking process. Squeeze excess water from spinach, 
            place spinach in a large bowl, and season with salt and pepper.

            Transfer onion to the bowl with spinach. Heat another 1 
            teaspoon oil in the same skillet. Cook mushrooms in the hot 
            oil until lightly browned but still firm, 1 to 2 minutes; 
            add to onion mixture. Heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil in the 
            same skillet. Cook carrot in the hot oil until lightly 
            browned but still crisp, 1 to 2 minutes; add to onion mixture.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Cook and stir beef in the same skillet until browned, 1 to 
            2 minutes; add to onion mixture. Cook and stir noodles in 
            the same skillet until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes; add 
            to beef-onion mixture. Add remaining sauce to beef-noodles 
            mixture and toss to coat using your hands.</li>
