        <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup light ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups coarsely shredded carrots</li>

        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
            lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until 
            cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. 
            Drain.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir 
            flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until 
            smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth 
            into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a 
            boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir 
            Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute c
            arrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 
            5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable 
            mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking 
            dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining 
            ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned 
            and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
